I’d like to use Quake 1 as an example, because the source code is widely available, and it’s considered a masterclass in software design.</p>\n<p>Games are notorious performance hogs. Developing a game like Quake 1 would have been exceptionally challenging, given the limited performance of the hardware at the time.</p>\n<img src=\"quake1.jpg\" class=\"img\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n<p>There’s a lot going on. The engine needs to figure out a lot of things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A level is big, so the engine needs to figure out the exact polygons the player sees. It does so using</li>\n<li>The engine also needs to figure out what enemies need to do in reaction to the player’s actions.</li>\n<li>Collision detection, i.e., has the player bumped into a wall and what to do as a result.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A huge part of the engine is visual surface determination.</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #292D3E\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">  </span><span style=\"color: #C792EA\">let</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> polygons </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">=</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> </span><span style=\"color: #82AAFF\">getVisiblePolygons</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">()</span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\">  </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF; font-style: italic\">for</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> (</span><span style=\"color: #C792EA\">let</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> polygon </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">of</span><span style=\"color: #A6ACCD\"> polygons) </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">{</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #F07178\">    </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #F07178\">  </span><span style=\"color: #89DDFF\">}</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>What we see is that</p>\n<img src=\"wireframe.png\" class=\"img\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n<p><em>And once all this is done, it needs to be rendered on the screen. That’s the inner loop.</em></p>\n<p>Most of the game engine is written in C, but the (software) rendering engine is written in assembly language. Why? Because true perspective correct rendering requires two division operations per pixel (bilinear filtering in software would have been out of the question at the time), and even so, significant were taken.</p>\n<h3>The Classic 3-Tier Architecture</h3>\n<p>This is quite academic, so how does this help is?
