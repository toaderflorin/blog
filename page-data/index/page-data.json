We talked about sharding, but probably most companies would want to do something other than roll out their custom sharding solution. A very simple way to improve performance is to implement a caching solution on your endpoints. But that still requires going to every endpoint and adding caching logic, thinking about cache eviction, etc.\n\n"}},{"excerpt":"A common theme on the blog is the practicality of approaches (and avoiding development dogma).

Continuing to build on a deprecated technology is obviously risky. As time passes, there are no more updates to the library, and finding developers willing to work on it becomes harder and harder, so this isn't really an option.

To make matters worse, a whopping 70% of projects are considered failures based on initial targets. Even if the teams use agile methodologies, a large number of the sprints will fail to meet their story point target. "}},{"excerpt":"Let’s consider several classes with public methods.

Let's also consider that they are  on the same hierarchical level and they can all see each other and call methods on one another. We can draw the following schematic indicating the dependency topology. Let's consider now what happens when component A needs a change in component D. We can obviously go ahead and make that change, but odds are that is going to have a  knock-on effect on other components that depend on it such as X and Y. Changes on these would potentially have more cascading effects and so on.

The CAP letters refer to Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance, and it’s worth mentioning that it is merely an idealization (abstraction) because real-world situations are significantly more complicated.

A few years after the pattern became popular, there was mounting criticism against it, mainly because of the complexity it introduces - with critics citing it as a typical example of over-engineering / premature optimization.

The notion of a function within another function itself isn't hard to understand, the significant hurdle in understanding comes with preserving the lexical environment around these functions once the parent function has finished executing. There are also quite a few articles that use misleading terminology -- for example, context versus execution context, lexical environment versus scope, etc. We'll aim to clarify the terms.

While getting a machine with more processor cores, memory and disk space can alleviate your problems in the short term, at some point needing to distribute your database across multiple machines becomes unavoidable.

When writing code, if a component depends on another component, they are said to be coupled, which is part of everyday development, so it's impossible to eliminate coupling altogether. What we should be striving for is low-coupling. The term spaghetti code gets thrown around quite a bit, and the reason for that is highly entangled codebases have very long and complicated dependency chains.

There are however differences between class components and function components related to how hooks work, which we'll look at next. With classes, component state is accessible via this.state, and updating it (and triggering component rerendering) is done via this.setState. In functional components, we use the <i>useState</i> hook and instead of merging the object we're passing in, the state is replaced.

The main advantage of this approach is familiarity, meaning that developers can structure their projects using a similar folder/code structure. There is, however, an alternative approach popularized by  Svelte, which is less verbose. While this is a familiar approach, many developers feel that the single-store architectural approach leads to bad software patterns.

Also, as a rule of thumb, we should avoid using as many external libraries as possible because chances are they could become deprecated in the future. While using the useReducer hook is relatively straightforward, React doesn't provide a prescription on how to structure a relatively large application.

Not long after, the container / presentational pattern appeared, where the state changes would be handled in a wrapping class component, and the inner child component would handle the presentation part.

A typical example would be an Excel spreadsheet: if a cell aggregates data from other cells, that cell instantly changes if we change a value in any of the aggregated cells. In reactive programming, if a variable A depends on B and C, a change in either B or C would also trigger a change in A. While there seems to be an ongoing debate whether React is truly reactive, there's no doubt that the UI reacts to changes in the data model, even if parts of the model itself don't react to other parts being changed, so from now on, we'll consider this definition of reactivity.
