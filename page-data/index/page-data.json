To make matters worse, in many projects, not a lot of thought is given to how the database is structured, and it might not actually align well with the business domain (especially if DDD techniques are not followed).

The idea behind it is it’s an implementation of Google’s Material Design, and it’s really opinionated in that regard, and herein lies one of its problems: a lot of designers don’t want their application to look like Gmail or Android, they will want a specific look and feel.

Well, the prevailing wisdom is no, because there is significant cost associated with maintaining, deploying, hosting., multiple microservices.Let's also look at some microservice tenets: 1. Microservices need to own their own data, which means you need a database for each. 2. Instead of synchronous communication, you usually use message based communication to ensure decoupling.

It involves incorporating game design elements such as points, badges, leaderboards, challenges, and rewards into non-game activities, such as marketing campaigns, educational programs, workplace training, and even daily tasks. The goal of gamification is to tap into the natural human desire for challenge, competition, and social interaction that we experience when playing games.

To make matters worse, a whopping 70% of projects are considered failures based on initial targets. Even if the teams use agile methodologies, a large number of the sprints will fail to meet their story point target.

A few years after the pattern became popular, there was mounting criticism against it, mainly because of the complexity it introduces - with critics citing it as a typical example of over-engineering / premature optimization.

The notion of a function within another function itself isn't hard to understand, the significant hurdle in understanding comes with preserving the lexical environment around these functions once the parent function has finished executing. There are also quite a few articles that use misleading terminology -- for example, context versus execution context, lexical environment versus scope, etc. We'll aim to clarify the terms.

While getting a machine with more processor cores, memory and disk space can alleviate your problems in the short term, at some point needing to distribute your database across multiple machines becomes unavoidable.

There are however differences between class components and function components related to how hooks work, which we'll look at next. With classes, component state is accessible via this.state, and updating it (and triggering component rerendering) is done via this.setState. In functional components, we use the useState hook and instead of merging the object we're passing in, the state is replaced.

The main advantage of this approach is familiarity, meaning that developers can structure their projects using a similar folder/code structure. There is, however, an alternative approach popularized by  Svelte, which is less verbose. While this is a familiar approach, many developers feel that the single-store architectural approach leads to bad software patterns.

Also, as a rule of thumb, we should avoid using as many external libraries as possible because chances are they could become deprecated in the future. While using the useReducer hook is relatively straightforward, React doesn't provide a prescription on how to structure a relatively large application.

Not long after, the container / presentational pattern appeared, where the state changes would be handled in a wrapping class component, and the inner child component would handle the presentation part.

A typical example would be an Excel spreadsheet: if a cell aggregates data from other cells, that cell instantly changes if we change a value in any of the aggregated cells. In reactive programming, if a variable A depends on B and C, a change in either B or C would also trigger a change in A. While there seems to be an ongoing debate whether React is truly reactive, there's no doubt that the UI reacts to changes in the data model, even if parts of the model itself don't react to other parts being changed, so from now on, we'll consider this definition of reactivity.
