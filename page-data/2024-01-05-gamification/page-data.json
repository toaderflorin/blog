Gamification is the process of applying game-like elements and mechanics to non-game contexts to enhance user engagement, motivation, and overall experience. It involves incorporating game design elements such as points, badges, leaderboards, challenges, and rewards into non-game activities, such as marketing campaigns, educational programs, workplace training, and even daily tasks. The goal of gamification is to tap into the natural human desire for challenge, competition, and social interaction that we experience when playing games.</p>\n<img src=\"stack.jpg\" class=\"img\" />\n<p>By incorporating these elements into non-game activities, gamification can make them more engaging, motivating, and ultimately more successful. Or so it is argued.\nIn theory, this sounds great. Except for when it isn’t.</p>\n<p>It’s argued that gamification can foster social connection by providing opportunities for collaboration, competition, and peer recognition in your team, because it introduces an element of playfulness in the SCRUM and development process, but I’ve found the opposite to be true in a lot of cases. Gamification is always tied to metrics, e.g., number of story points closed or tickets.</p>\n<p>It can lead to people trying to game the system, which in turn can lead to resentment and a toxic environment.</p>\n<h2>Chasing (Story) Points</h2>\n<p>Imagine an NBA team. Not all players have the same role. Now imagine that all players are evaluated based on the number of points they score. What will happen is instead of the players working as a team, they will compete for the ball between themselves, as well as against the other team. In hid infamous title defense against Demian Maia, the Anderson Silva used a simple strategy. Knowing that Maya is a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu phenom, he tried to avoid getting into close contact at all costs, simply resorting to a strategy where he would pepper him with shots from</p>\n<p><em>In fact, he did the bare minimum to win the fight and retain his title.</em></p>\n<p>He won on points, and that was the whole strategy.</p>\n<p>In many companies, various metrics will be used in conjunction with stack ranking, which is now an infamous tactic.</p>\n<p>In November 2013, Microsoft Corp. announced it had ended its controversial “stack ranking” employee-review and compensation system and no longer requires managers to grade employees against one another and rank them on a scale of 1 to 5. The most contentious aspect of this approach was\nits targeted, or forced, distribution requirements, which meant managers had to designate a small percentage of their direct reports as underperformers.</p>\n<p>Stack ranking, also known as forced ranking, is an employee evaluation method that categorizes employees into a predetermined distribution of performance levels, typically a bell curve. This method is commonly used in software development companies to assess and compare the performance of their employees. In stack ranking, managers are tasked with placing each employee within a specific performance category, such as “exceeds expectations,” “meets expectations,” “needs improvement,” or “underperforms.” This process often involves comparing employees against each other, which can create a competitive and sometimes adversarial environment within teams.</p>\n<h2>Writing Software Is a Collaborative Effort</h2>\n<p>While stack ranking aims to identify and reward top performers, it has been criticized for its drawbacks and negative impacts on employee morale, motivation, and overall team dynamics.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will always require assistance from other people when changing their code. If the environment is hostile, it might lead to information hiding.</li>\n<li>Merging your code requires passing code reviews, and some developers can develop passive-aggressive attitudes and reject pull requests for small teams. This in turn requires other developers to constantly task switch, etc. which can lead to frustration and wasted time.</li>\n<li>Developers might take shortcuts in how they write their code, just to be able to “close the task” and “get the story points” at the end of the sprint.</li>\n<li>Many times as a developer, you will be blocked by other tasks and sometimes all it takes is a small easy fix from a team member.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately, my feeling is it leads to a zero-sum game mentality, and it should be used with caution.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Gamification Leads To People Gaming The System","date":"January 01, 2024","description":"Gamification is the process of applying game-like elements and mechanics to non-game contexts to enhance user engagement, motivation, and overall experience.
